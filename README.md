# firstNodeProject

This is my first node project. It is a short file that generates a guest list of ten. Which may perhaps be the correct number of guests for many occasions. 

For one occasion in particular it would be great for an amount of people to play a game of Poker.

Within this app I hope to be able to successfully build a small node application and use some basic functionality of node and it's many, many modules.

This file will be updated to include a list of features. This currently uses the axios and faker libraries. It uses the axios library to make a request for some number data from the Numbers API and the faker library to generate a list of ten guests.
